# This example shows how to use critic2 to perform arithmetic
# operations with grids, and calculate grid integrals over the whole
# cell. In all cases, the part of the output that gives the cell
# integral is:
#
#     Cell integral (grid SUM) = -23.73340101
#
# which is simply the sum over all the values in the grid, times the
# volume, divided by the number of points

# The energy components in the total energy can be calculated by using
