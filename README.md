# Critic2
## Overview

Critic2 is a program for the manipulation and analysis of structures
and chemical information in molecules and periodic solids. Critic2 can
be used to read and transform between file formats, and to perform
operations on molecular and crystal structures. In addition, critic2
can read multiple scalar fields, three-dimensional functions that take
a value at each point in space, such as the density, the spin density,
the ELF, etc. This program provides tools to analyze and manipulate
the information in these fields. An important part of critic2 is the
topological anaylisis of real-space scalar fields, which includes the
implementation of Bader's atoms in molecules theory: critical point
search, basin integration, basin plotting, etc. Other related
techniques, such as non-covalent interaction plots (NCIplots), are
also implemented. Although the electron density is the usual field
critic2 works with, any other field (ELF, molecular electrostatic
potential,...) can be analyzed using the same techniques. Hence, it is
possible to compute, for instance, the charges inside the basins of
ELF, or the gradient paths of the molecular electrostatic
potential. New scalar fields can be computed using critic2's powerful
arithmetic expressions.

Critic2 is designed to provide an abstraction layer on top of the
underlying electronic structure calculation. Different electronic
structure methods (FPLAPW, pseudopotentials, local orbitals,...)
represent the electron density, and other fields, in different
ways. The program interfaces to many of these and applies common
techniques and algorithms to them. At present, critic2 can interface
to WIEN2k, elk, PI, Quantum ESPRESSO, abinit, VASP, DFTB+, Gaussian,
psi4, siesta, and to any other program capable of writing the scalar
field of interest to a grid. Many more structural file formats are
supported, and critic2 provides basic crystallographic and structural
computing tools (e.g. crystal structure comparison, molecular
environment generation, file conversion).

## Compilation and installation

If you downloaded the code from the git repository and not from a
package, you will need to run:

    autoreconf -i

Prepare for compilation by doing:

    ./configure

Use <code>configure --help</code> for information about the
compilation options. The <code>--prefix</code> option sets the
installation path; more details about configure can be found in the
INSTALL file. Once critic2 is configured, compile using:

    make

This should create the critic2 executable inside the src/
subdirectory. The binary can be used directly or the entire critic2
distribution can be installed to the 'prefix' path by doing:

    make install

Critic2 is parallelized for shared-memory architectures (unless
compiled with <code>--disable-openmp</code>). You change the number of
parallel threads by setting the <code>OMP_NUM_THREADS</code>
environment variable. Note that the parallelization flags for
compilers other than ifort and gfortran may not be correct.

In the case of ifort (and maybe other compilers), sometimes it may be
necessary to increase the stack size using, for instance:

export OMP_STACKSIZE=128M

This applies in particular to integrations using YT.

The environment variable CRITIC_HOME is necessary if critic2 was not
installed with 'make install'. It must point to the root directory of
the distribution:

    export CRITIC_HOME=/home/alberto/programs/critic2dir

This variable is necessary for critic2 to find the atomic densities,
the cif dictionary and the library data. These should be in
${CRITIC_HOME}/dat/.

## Which compilers work?

Critic2 uses some features from the more modern Fortran standards,
which may not be available in old compilers. In consequence, not all
compilers may be able to generate the binary. Two versions of critic2
are distributed. The *development* version, corresponding to the
master branch of the repository, and the *stable* version, in the
stable branch. Only patches addressing serious bugs will be introduced
in the stable version; all new development happens in the development
version.

The stable version is compilable by all versions of gfortran starting
at 4.9. All intel fortran compiler versions from 2011 onwards also
compile the stable code.

The development version can be compiled with gfortran-6 and later, and
with ifort 14.0 and later. The specific issues are:

* gfortran 4.8: allocatable components in user-defined types not
  supported. 
* gfortran 4.9 through 5.4 (and possible older gfortran-5): errors
  allocating and deallocating the global field array (sy%f).
* ifort 12.1: catastrophic internal compiler error. 

The following compilers work for the development version:
gfortran-6.3.0, ifort-14.0.2.144, ifort-15.0.5.233, and ifort-15.2. 

If a recent compiler is not available, an alternative is to compile
the program elsewhere with the static linking option:

    LDFLAGS=-static ./configure ...

provided the machine has the same architecture. You can choose the
compiler by changing the FC and F77 flags before configure:

    FC=gfortran F77=gfortran ./configure ...

## Compiling and using libxc

Critic2 can be compiled with libxc support. Libxc is a library that
implements exchange-correlation energies and potentials. It is used in
critic2 to calculate exchange and correlation energy densities via the
xc() function in arithmetic expressions. 

To compile critic2 with libxc support, two --with-libxc options must
be passed to configure:

    ./configure --with-libxc-prefix=/opt/libxc --with-libxc-include=/opt/libxc/include

Here the /opt/libxc directory is the target for the libxc installation
(use --prefix=/opt/libxc when you configure libxc). Make sure that you
use the same compiler for libxc and for critic2; otherwise the library
will not be linked. See 'Use of LIBXC in arithmetic expressions' in
the user's guide for instructions on how to use libxc in critic2.

## Using critic2

The user's guide is in the doc/ directory in plain text format
(user-guide.txt). A copy of the manual in PDF format (user-guide.pdf)
can be generated by running the compile.sh script. This requires a
working LaTeX installation, the rst2latex program (included in the
docutils package), and awk. A concise summary of the syntax can be
found in the syntax.txt file. Several examples are provided in the
examples/ subdirectory.

Critic2 reads a single input file (the cri file). A simple input is:

    crystal cubicBN.cube
    load cubicBN.cube
    yt

which reads the crystal structure from a cube file, then the electron
density from the same cube file, and then calculates the atomic
charges and volumes. Run critic2 as:

    critic2 cubicBN.cri cubicBN.cro

A detailed description of the keywords accepted by critic2 is given in
the user's guide and a short reference in the syntax.txt file.
